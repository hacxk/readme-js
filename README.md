## Fundamentals: Laying the Foundation

### Variables, Data Types, and Operators

In this section, we'll explore the basic building blocks of JavaScript: variables, data types, and operators. Understanding these fundamental concepts is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code.

#### Variables

Variables in JavaScript are containers for storing data values. They are declared using the `let`, `const`, or `var` keywords:

```javascript
// Using let (block-scoped, reassignable)
let jediName = "Luke Skywalker";
jediName = "Rey"; // This is allowed

// Using const (block-scoped, not reassignable)
const galaxyName = "Milky Way";
// galaxyName = "Andromeda"; // This would throw an error

// Using var (function-scoped, reassignable - not recommended in modern JavaScript)
var shipName = "Millennium Falcon";
```

Best practices:
- Use `const` by default for variables that won't be reassigned.
- Use `let` for variables that will be reassigned.
- Avoid using `var` in modern JavaScript code.

#### Data Types

JavaScript has several built-in data types:

1. **Strings**: Used for text data.
   ```javascript
   let characterName = "Obi-Wan Kenobi";
   let quote = 'May the Force be with you.';
   ```

2. **Numbers**: Used for numeric data (integers and floating-point numbers).
   ```javascript
   let age = 900; // Yoda's age
   let midiChlorianCount = 20000.5;
   ```

3. **Booleans**: Represent true or false values.
   ```javascript
   let isJedi = true;
   let isSith = false;
   ```

4. **Undefined**: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   ```javascript
   let padawan;
   console.log(padawan); // Output: undefined
   ```

5. **Null**: Represents a deliberate non-value or absence of any object value.
   ```javascript
   let emptyness = null;
   ```

6. **Objects**: Used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
   ```javascript
   let starship = {
     name: "X-wing",
     model: "T-65",
     manufacturer: "Incom Corporation"
   };
   ```

7. **Arrays**: Used to store lists of data.
   ```javascript
   let jediCouncil = ["Yoda", "Mace Windu", "Obi-Wan Kenobi"];
   ```

8. **Functions**: A type of object that can be called to perform actions.
   ```javascript
   function useTheForce() {
     console.log("May the Force be with you!");
   }
   ```

#### Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values:

1. **Arithmetic Operators**:
   ```javascript
   let a = 10;
   let b = 5;
   
   console.log(a + b);  // Addition: 15
   console.log(a - b);  // Subtraction: 5
   console.log(a * b);  // Multiplication: 50
   console.log(a / b);  // Division: 2
   console.log(a % b);  // Modulus (remainder): 0
   console.log(a ** b); // Exponentiation: 100000
   ```

2. **Comparison Operators**:
   ```javascript
   console.log(a > b);   // Greater than: true
   console.log(a < b);   // Less than: false
   console.log(a >= b);  // Greater than or equal to: true
   console.log(a <= b);  // Less than or equal to: false
   console.log(a === b); // Strict equality: false
   console.log(a !== b); // Strict inequality: true
   ```

3. **Logical Operators**:
   ```javascript
   let isJedi = true;
   let hasForcePowers = true;
   
   console.log(isJedi && hasForcePowers); // Logical AND: true
   console.log(isJedi || hasForcePowers); // Logical OR: true
   console.log(!isJedi);                  // Logical NOT: false
   ```

4. **Assignment Operators**:
   ```javascript
   let x = 5;
   x += 3; // Equivalent to: x = x + 3
   console.log(x); // Output: 8
   
   x *= 2; // Equivalent to: x = x * 2
   console.log(x); // Output: 16
   ```

5. **Ternary Operator**:
   ```javascript
   let age = 20;
   let status = (age >= 18) ? "adult" : "minor";
   console.log(status); // Output: "adult"
   ```

Understanding these fundamental concepts of variables, data types, and operators is crucial as we move forward in our JavaScript journey. They form the building blocks upon which we'll construct more complex programs and applications.

### Control Flow (if-else, Loops)

Control flow is the order in which individual statements, instructions, or function calls are executed in a program. In JavaScript, we use control structures to determine the flow of our code based on certain conditions or to repeat a block of code multiple times.

#### Conditional Statements

Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on specified conditions.

1. **if statement**:
   The `if` statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

   ```javascript
   let forceSensitivity = 7000;

   if (forceSensitivity > 5000) {
     console.log("You have the potential to become a Jedi!");
   }
   ```

2. **if...else statement**:
   The `if...else` statement executes one block of code if a condition is true and another if it's false.

   ```javascript
   let alignment = "light";

   if (alignment === "light") {
     console.log("Welcome to the Jedi Order!");
   } else {
     console.log("Beware the path to the dark side.");
   }
   ```

3. **if...else if...else statement**:
   This structure allows you to check multiple conditions.

   ```javascript
   let midiChlorianCount = 20000;

   if (midiChlorianCount > 20000) {
     console.log("You have exceptional Force abilities!");
   } else if (midiChlorianCount > 10000) {
     console.log("You have strong Force potential.");
   } else {
     console.log("Your connection to the Force is present, but limited.");
   }
   ```

4. **switch statement**:
   The `switch` statement can be used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

   ```javascript
   let lightsaberColor = "blue";

   switch (lightsaberColor) {
     case "blue":
       console.log("A lightsaber of a Jedi Guardian.");
       break;
     case "green":
       console.log("A lightsaber of a Jedi Consular.");
       break;
     case "purple":
       console.log("A rare lightsaber color, mastered by only a few.");
       break;
     default:
       console.log("An unusual lightsaber color.");
   }
   ```

#### Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. They're essential for iterating over data structures, performing repetitive tasks, and implementing algorithms.

1. **for loop**:
   The `for` loop repeats a block of code a specified number of times.

   ```javascript
   // Count from 1 to 10
   for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
     console.log(`Count: ${i}`);
   }

   // Iterating over an array
   let jediMasters = ["Yoda", "Obi-Wan", "Mace Windu", "Qui-Gon Jinn"];
   for (let i = 0; i < jediMasters.length; i++) {
     console.log(`Jedi Master: ${jediMasters[i]}`);
   }
   ```

2. **while loop**:
   The `while` loop repeats a block of code while a specified condition is true.

   ```javascript
   let forcePower = 0;
   while (forcePower < 100) {
     console.log(`Current Force power: ${forcePower}`);
     forcePower += 10;
   }
   ```

3. **do...while loop**:
   The `do...while` loop is similar to the while loop, but it always executes the code block at least once before checking the condition.

   ```javascript
   let attempts = 0;
   do {
     console.log(`Attempt ${attempts + 1} to lift the X-wing`);
     attempts++;
   } while (attempts < 3);
   ```

4. **for...of loop**:
   The `for...of` loop is used to iterate over iterable objects (arrays, strings, etc.).

   ```javascript
   let planets = ["Tatooine", "Coruscant", "Hoth", "Endor"];
   for (let planet of planets) {
     console.log(`Visiting planet: ${planet}`);
   }
   ```

5. **for...in loop**:
   The `for...in` loop is used to iterate over the properties of an object.

   ```javascript
   let darthVader = {
     realName: "Anakin Skywalker",
     title: "Dark Lord of the Sith",
     formerAllegiance: "Jedi Order"
   };

   for (let key in darthVader) {
     console.log(`${key}: ${darthVader[key]}`);
   }
   ```

#### Advanced Loop Techniques

1. **Breaking and Continuing**:
   The `break` statement is used to exit a loop prematurely, while the `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.

   ```javascript
   // Using break
   for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
     if (i === 5) break;
     console.log(i);
   }
   // Output: 1, 2, 3, 4

   // Using continue
   for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
     if (i === 3) continue;
     console.log(i);
   }
   // Output: 1, 2, 4, 5
   ```

2. **Nested Loops**:
   Loops can be nested inside other loops to work with multi-dimensional data structures or perform more complex iterations.

   ```javascript
   let galaxyGrid = [
     ["*", " ", "*"],
     [" ", "*", " "],
     ["*", " ", "*"]
   ];

   for (let i = 0; i < galaxyGrid.length; i++) {
     let row = "";
     for (let j = 0; j < galaxyGrid[i].length; j++) {
       row += galaxyGrid[i][j];
     }
     console.log(row);
   }
   // Output:
   // * *
   //  * 
   // * *
   ```

3. **Array Methods as Loop Alternatives**:
   Modern JavaScript provides array methods that can often replace traditional loops, making code more readable and functional.

   ```javascript
   let jedis = ["Luke", "Leia", "Rey", "Obi-Wan"];

   // forEach
   jedis.forEach(jedi => console.log(`May the Force be with you, ${jedi}`));

   // map
   let greetings = jedis.map(jedi => `Hello there, ${jedi}!`);

   // filter
   let longNames = jedis.filter(jedi => jedi.length > 3);

   // reduce
   let totalLetters = jedis.reduce((sum, jedi) => sum + jedi.length, 0);
   ```

Understanding control flow is crucial for writing effective JavaScript code. It allows you to create dynamic, responsive programs that can make decisions and handle repetitive tasks efficiently. As you progress in your Jedi training, you'll find yourself combining these control structures in increasingly complex and powerful ways.

### Functions: Building Blocks of Reusability

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. They allow you to encapsulate a piece of code that performs a specific task, making it reusable and easier to manage. Let's explore the various aspects of functions in JavaScript.

#### Function Declaration

The basic syntax for declaring a function is as follows:

```javascript
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // function body
  return result; // optional
}
```

Here's an example of a simple function:

```javascript
function greetJedi(name) {
  return `May the Force be with you, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greetJedi("Obi-Wan")); // Output: May the Force be with you, Obi-Wan!
```

#### Function Expressions

Functions can also be defined as expressions:

```javascript
let calculatePower = function(strength, wisdom) {
  return strength * wisdom;
};

console.log(calculatePower(10, 8)); // Output: 80
```

#### Arrow Functions

Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a more concise syntax for writing function expressions:

```javascript
let squarePower = (power) => power * power;

console.log(squarePower(4)); // Output: 16

// For single parameters, parentheses are optional
let doubleStrength = strength => strength * 2;

// For functions with no parameters, use empty parentheses
let useTheForce = () => console.log("Using the Force!");
```

#### Parameters and Arguments

Functions can take parameters, which act as placeholders for values that will be passed when the function is called:

```javascript
function createLightsaber(color, type = "single-bladed") {
  return `You have created a ${color} ${type} lightsaber!`;
}

console.log(createLightsaber("blue")); 
// Output: You have created a blue single-bladed lightsaber!

console.log(createLightsaber("red", "double-bladed")); 
// Output: You have created a red double-bladed lightsaber!
```

In this example, `type` has a default value, which is used if no second argument is provided.

#### Rest Parameters

The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array:

```javascript
function gatherAllies(...allies) {
  console.log(`You have gathered ${allies.length} allies:`);
  allies.forEach(ally => console.log(`- ${ally}`));
}

gatherAllies("Luke", "Leia", "Han", "Chewbacca");
// Output:
// You have gathered 4 allies:
// - Luke
// - Leia
// - Han
// - Chewbacca
```

#### Return Statement

Functions can return values using the `return` statement. If no return statement is used, or an empty return is given, the function will return `undefined`.

```javascript
function calculateMidiChlorianLevel(baseLevel, forceSensitivity) {
  let level = baseLevel * forceSensitivity;
  if (level > 20000) {
    return "Exceptionally high";
  } else if (level > 10000) {
    return "Very high";
  } else {
    return "Average";
  }
}

console.log(calculateMidiChlorianLevel(5000, 3)); // Output: Very high
```

#### Function Scope

Variables declared inside a function are only accessible within that function:

```javascript
function jediTraining() {
  let skill = "Lightsaber combat";
  console.log(`Training in ${skill}`);
}

jediTraining(); // Output: Training in Lightsaber combat
// console.log(skill); // This would throw an error
```

#### Closures

A closure is a function that has access to variables in its outer (enclosing) lexical scope, even after the outer function has returned:

```javascript
function createJedi(name) {
  let forceLevel = 0;
  
  return {
    getName: () => name,
    train: () => {
      forceLevel++;
      console.log(`${name}'s force level is now ${forceLevel}`);
    }
  };
}

let luke = createJedi("Luke");
luke.train(); // Output: Luke's force level is now 1
luke.train(); // Output: Luke's force level is now 2
console.log(luke.getName()); // Output: Luke
```

#### Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE)

An IIFE is a function that runs as soon as it is defined:

```javascript
(function() {
  let secretCode = "May the Force be with you";
  console.log("This function is executed immediately!");
})();

// console.log(secretCode); // This would throw an error
```

IIFEs are often used to create a new scope and avoid polluting the global namespace.

#### Higher-Order Functions

Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions:

```javascript
function applyForceSkill(skill) {
  return function(target) {
    console.log(`Using ${skill} on ${target}!`);
  };
}

let forcePush = applyForceSkill("Force Push");
forcePush("Battle Droid"); // Output: Using Force Push on Battle Droid!

let mindTrick = applyForceSkill("Jedi Mind Trick");
mindTrick("Weak-minded guard"); // Output: Using Jedi Mind Trick on Weak-minded guard!
```

Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, and mastering them is crucial for becoming a true JavaScript Jedi. They allow you to write more modular, reusable, and maintainable code. As you progress in your training, you'll discover even more advanced techniques and patterns involving functions.

### Arrays and Objects: Mastering Data Structures

Arrays and objects are two fundamental data structures in JavaScript that allow you to organize and manipulate collections of data. Understanding how to work with these structures is crucial for effective JavaScript programming.

#### Arrays

An array is an ordered collection of values. It can hold values of any type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

##### Creating Arrays

```javascript
// Array literal notation
let jediCouncil = ["Yoda", "Mace Windu", "Obi-Wan Kenobi"];

// Using the Array constructor
let sithLords = new Array("Darth Sidious", "Darth Vader", "Darth Maul");

// Array with mixed data types
let anakinSkywalker = ["Anakin", "Skywalker", 22, true, ["PadmÃ©", "Obi-Wan"]];
```

##### Accessing Array Elements

Array elements are accessed using their index, which starts at 0:

```javascript
console.log(jediCouncil[0]); // Output: Yoda
console.log(jediCouncil[2]); // Output: Obi-Wan Kenobi

// Accessing nested array elements
console.log(anakinSkywalker[4][0]); // Output: PadmÃ©
```

##### Array Methods

JavaScript provides many built-in methods for working with arrays:

1. **Adding and Removing Elements**:
   ```javascript
   let planets = ["Tatooine", "Hoth"];

   // Add to the end
   planets.push("Endor");
   console.log(planets); // Output: ["Tatooine", "Hoth", "Endor"]

   // Remove from the end
   let lastPlanet = planets.pop();
   console.log(lastPlanet); // Output: Endor
   console.log(planets); // Output: ["Tatooine", "Hoth"]

   // Add to the beginning
   planets.unshift("Coruscant");
   console.log(planets); // Output: ["Coruscant", "Tatooine", "Hoth"]

   // Remove from the beginning
   let firstPlanet = planets.shift();
   console.log(firstPlanet); // Output: Coruscant
   console.log(planets); // Output: ["Tatooine", "Hoth"]
   ```

2. **Finding Elements**:
   ```javascript
   let jediMasters = ["Yoda", "Obi-Wan", "Luke", "Rey"];

   console.log(jediMasters.indexOf("Luke")); // Output: 2
   console.log(jediMasters.includes("Anakin")); // Output: false

   // Find the first element that satisfies a condition
   let powerfulJedi = jediMasters.find(jedi => jedi.length > 4);
   console.log(powerfulJedi); // Output: Obi-Wan
   ```

3. **Transforming Arrays**:
   ```javascript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   // Map: Create a new array by transforming each element
   let squares = numbers.map(num => num * num);
   console.log(squares); // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

   // Filter: Create a new array with elements that pass a test
   let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
   console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4]

   // Reduce: Reduce the array to a single value
   let sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
   console.log(sum); // Output: 15
   ```

4. **Sorting and Reversing**:
   ```javascript
   let characters = ["Luke", "Leia", "Han", "Chewbacca"];
   
   characters.sort();
   console.log(characters); // Output: ["Chewbacca", "Han", "Leia", "Luke"]

   characters.reverse();
   console.log(characters); // Output: ["Luke", "Leia", "Han", "Chewbacca"]
   ```

5. **Slicing and Splicing**:
   ```javascript
   let original = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

   // Slice: Extract a portion of an array
   let sliced = original.slice(1, 4);
   console.log(sliced); // Output: ["b", "c", "d"]

   // Splice: Change the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements
  original.splice(2, 1, "X", "Y");
   console.log(original); // Output: ["a", "b", "X", "Y", "d", "e"]
   ```

6. **Flattening Arrays**:
   ```javascript
   let nestedArray = [1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]];
   let flattened = nestedArray.flat(2);
   console.log(flattened); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
   ```

7. **Iterating Over Arrays**:
   ```javascript
   let jediPowers = ["Force Push", "Mind Trick", "Lightsaber Throw"];

   // forEach: Executes a provided function once for each array element
   jediPowers.forEach(power => console.log(`Jedi power: ${power}`));

   // for...of: Iterates over the values in an array
   for (let power of jediPowers) {
     console.log(`Using ${power}`);
   }
   ```

#### Objects

Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. They allow you to store and organize related data and functionality.

##### Creating Objects

```javascript
// Object literal notation
let obiWan = {
  name: "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
  age: 57,
  lightsaberColor: "blue",
  rank: "Jedi Master"
};

// Using the Object constructor
let yoda = new Object();
yoda.name = "Yoda";
yoda.age = 900;
yoda.species = "Unknown";

// Using Object.create()
let jediPrototype = {
  useTheForce: function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is using the Force!`);
  }
};
let ahsoka = Object.create(jediPrototype);
ahsoka.name = "Ahsoka Tano";
```

##### Accessing Object Properties

```javascript
console.log(obiWan.name); // Output: Obi-Wan Kenobi
console.log(obiWan["lightsaberColor"]); // Output: blue

// Using variables as keys
let propertyName = "rank";
console.log(obiWan[propertyName]); // Output: Jedi Master
```

##### Modifying Objects

```javascript
// Adding new properties
obiWan.homeworld = "Stewjon";

// Modifying existing properties
obiWan.age = 58;

// Deleting properties
delete obiWan.rank;

console.log(obiWan);
```

##### Object Methods

Objects can also contain functions as values, which we call methods:

```javascript
let darthVader = {
  name: "Anakin Skywalker",
  side: "dark",
  useLightsaber: function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} ignites his red lightsaber!`);
  },
  // Shorthand method syntax (ES6+)
  useForceChoke() {
    console.log(`${this.name} uses Force choke. Beware the dark side!`);
  }
};

darthVader.useLightsaber(); // Output: Anakin Skywalker ignites his red lightsaber!
darthVader.useForceChoke(); // Output: Anakin Skywalker uses Force choke. Beware the dark side!
```

##### Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries()

These methods allow you to work with object properties and values:

```javascript
let lightsaber = {
  color: "green",
  type: "single-bladed",
  owner: "Luke Skywalker"
};

console.log(Object.keys(lightsaber)); 
// Output: ["color", "type", "owner"]

console.log(Object.values(lightsaber)); 
// Output: ["green", "single-bladed", "Luke Skywalker"]

console.log(Object.entries(lightsaber)); 
// Output: [["color", "green"], ["type", "single-bladed"], ["owner", "Luke Skywalker"]]
```

##### Nested Objects

Objects can contain other objects, allowing for more complex data structures:

```javascript
let starWarsUniverse = {
  jediOrder: {
    grandMaster: "Yoda",
    council: ["Mace Windu", "Ki-Adi-Mundi", "Plo Koon"],
    temple: {
      location: "Coruscant",
      rooms: ["Council Chamber", "Training Grounds", "Archives"]
    }
  },
  sithOrder: {
    masterAndApprentice: {
      master: "Darth Sidious",
      apprentice: "Darth Vader"
    }
  }
};

console.log(starWarsUniverse.jediOrder.temple.rooms[1]); // Output: Training Grounds
console.log(starWarsUniverse.sithOrder.masterAndApprentice.master); // Output: Darth Sidious
```

##### Object Destructuring

Object destructuring allows you to extract multiple properties from an object and assign them to variables in a single statement:

```javascript
let { grandMaster, council } = starWarsUniverse.jediOrder;
console.log(grandMaster); // Output: Yoda
console.log(council); // Output: ["Mace Windu", "Ki-Adi-Mundi", "Plo Koon"]

// Destructuring with renaming
let { master: sithMaster, apprentice: sithApprentice } = starWarsUniverse.sithOrder.masterAndApprentice;
console.log(sithMaster); // Output: Darth Sidious
console.log(sithApprentice); // Output: Darth Vader
```

##### Computed Property Names

ES6 introduced the ability to use expressions for property names:

```javascript
let propertyPrefix = "jedi";
let jediInfo = {
  [`${propertyPrefix}Name`]: "Obi-Wan Kenobi",
  [`${propertyPrefix}Rank`]: "Master"
};

console.log(jediInfo.jediName); // Output: Obi-Wan Kenobi
console.log(jediInfo.jediRank); // Output: Master
```

##### Object Spread Operator

The spread operator can be used to create shallow copies of objects or merge objects:

```javascript
let baseLightsaber = { type: "single-bladed", powerSource: "kyber crystal" };
let lukeLightsaber = { ...baseLightsaber, color: "green", owner: "Luke Skywalker" };

console.log(lukeLightsaber);
// Output: { type: "single-bladed", powerSource: "kyber crystal", color: "green", owner: "Luke Skywalker" }

// Merging objects
let anakinTraits = { name: "Anakin Skywalker", side: "light" };
let darthVaderTraits = { side: "dark", title: "Dark Lord of the Sith" };
let completeCharacter = { ...anakinTraits, ...darthVaderTraits };

console.log(completeCharacter);
// Output: { name: "Anakin Skywalker", side: "dark", title: "Dark Lord of the Sith" }
```

Understanding arrays and objects is crucial for effective JavaScript programming. These data structures allow you to organize and manipulate complex data in powerful ways. As you continue your journey to becoming a JavaScript Jedi Master, you'll find yourself using these concepts in increasingly sophisticated ways to solve a wide range of programming challenges.

## DOM Manipulation: Sculpting the Web

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like hierarchy of objects, where each object represents a part of the document. JavaScript can interact with and manipulate the DOM, allowing you to dynamically change the content, structure, and style of web pages.

### Selecting and Modifying Elements

#### Selecting Elements

JavaScript provides several methods to select elements from the DOM:

1. **getElementById**: Selects a single element by its ID attribute.
   ```javascript
   let jediTitle = document.getElementById("jedi-title");
   ```

2. **getElementsByClassName**: Selects multiple elements by their class name.
   ```javascript
   let forceUsers = document.getElementsByClassName("force-user");
   ```

3. **getElementsByTagName**: Selects all elements of a specified tag name.
   ```javascript
   let paragraphs = document.getElementsByTagName("p");
   ```

4. **querySelector**: Selects the first element that matches a CSS selector.
   ```javascript
   let firstJedi = document.querySelector(".jedi");
   ```

5. **querySelectorAll**: Selects all elements that match a CSS selector.
   ```javascript
   let allJedi = document.querySelectorAll(".jedi");
   ```

#### Modifying Elements

Once you've selected an element, you can modify its content, attributes, and styles:

1. **Changing Text Content**:
   ```javascript
   let title = document.getElementById("main-title");
   title.textContent = "Welcome to the Jedi Academy";
   ```

2. **Changing HTML Content**:
   ```javascript
   let description = document.querySelector(".description");
   description.innerHTML = "Learn the ways of the <strong>Force</strong>";
   ```

3. **Modifying Attributes**:
   ```javascript
   let link = document.querySelector("a");
   link.setAttribute("href", "https://www.jediorder.com");
   link.getAttribute("href"); // Returns "https://www.jediorder.com"
   ```

4. **Changing Styles**:
   ```javascript
   let header = document.querySelector("header");
   header.style.backgroundColor = "#000";
   header.style.color = "#FFD700";
   ```

5. **Manipulating Classes**:
   ```javascript
   let button = document.querySelector(".action-btn");
   button.classList.add("highlight");
   button.classList.remove("disabled");
   button.classList.toggle("active");
   ```

### Event Handling

Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them. In the context of the DOM, events can be things like a user clicking a button, scrolling the page, or pressing a key.

#### Adding Event Listeners

The `addEventListener` method is used to attach an event handler to an element:

```javascript
let lightsaberButton = document.getElementById("ignite-lightsaber");

lightsaberButton.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  console.log("Lightsaber ignited!");
  event.target.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
});
```

#### Common DOM Events

1. **Mouse Events**: `click`, `dblclick`, `mouseenter`, `mouseleave`
2. **Keyboard Events**: `keydown`, `keyup`, `keypress`
3. **Form Events**: `submit`, `change`, `focus`, `blur`
4. **Window Events**: `load`, `resize`, `scroll`

Example using multiple event types:

```javascript
let forcePowerInput = document.getElementById("force-power");

forcePowerInput.addEventListener("focus", function() {
  this.style.backgroundColor = "lightyellow";
});

forcePowerInput.addEventListener("blur", function() {
  this.style.backgroundColor = "";
});

forcePowerInput.addEventListener("change", function() {
  console.log(`Force power set to: ${this.value}`);
});
```

#### Event Delegation

Event delegation is a technique where you add a single event listener to a parent element to handle events for all of its child elements, even those added dynamically:

```javascript
let jediList = document.getElementById("jedi-list");

jediList.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
    console.log(`Selected Jedi: ${event.target.textContent}`);
    event.target.classList.toggle("selected");
  }
});
```

### Creating Dynamic Content

JavaScript allows you to create, modify, and delete elements in the DOM dynamically.

#### Creating New Elements

```javascript
let newJedi = document.createElement("div");
newJedi.className = "jedi-card";
newJedi.textContent = "Ahsoka Tano";

let jediContainer = document.getElementById("jedi-container");
jediContainer.appendChild(newJedi);
```

#### Removing Elements

```javascript
let oldJedi = document.querySelector(".retired");
oldJedi.parentNode.removeChild(oldJedi);

// Or using the more modern remove() method
oldJedi.remove();
```

#### Cloning Elements

```javascript
let originalJedi = document.querySelector(".jedi-template");
let clonedJedi = originalJedi.cloneNode(true); // true for deep clone
clonedJedi.id = "new-jedi";
document.body.appendChild(clonedJedi);
```

#### Inserting Elements

```javascript
let referenceElement = document.getElementById("last-jedi");
let newElement = document.createElement("div");
newElement.textContent = "Rey";

// Insert before the reference element
referenceElement.parentNode.insertBefore(newElement, referenceElement);

// Insert after the reference element
referenceElement.parentNode.insertBefore(newElement, referenceElement.nextSibling);
```

#### Creating Complex Structures

You can create more complex DOM structures by combining these techniques:

```javascript
function createJediCard(name, rank) {
  let card = document.createElement("div");
  card.className = "jedi-card";

  let nameElement = document.createElement("h2");
  nameElement.textContent = name;

  let rankElement = document.createElement("p");
  rankElement.textContent = `Rank: ${rank}`;

  let actionButton = document.createElement("button");
  actionButton.textContent = "Use the Force";
  actionButton.addEventListener("click", function() {
    console.log(`${name} is using the Force!`);
  });

  card.appendChild(nameElement);
  card.appendChild(rankElement);
  card.appendChild(actionButton);

  return card;
}

let jediContainer = document.getElementById("jedi-container");
let obiWanCard = createJediCard("Obi-Wan Kenobi", "Master");
jediContainer.appendChild(obiWanCard);
```

Mastering DOM manipulation is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages. It allows you to respond to user actions, update content in real-time, and create rich user experiences. As you continue your journey to becoming a JavaScript Jedi, you'll find yourself combining these techniques in increasingly sophisticated ways to bring your web applications to life.

## Advanced JavaScript

As you progress in your JavaScript journey, you'll encounter more advanced concepts that will elevate your coding skills to new heights. Let's explore some of these powerful features that will make you a true JavaScript Jedi.

### Closures

Closures are one of the most powerful features of JavaScript. A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared. This environment consists of any local variables that were in-scope at the time the closure was created.

#### Basic Closure Example

```javascript
function createJedi(name) {
  let forcePower = 0;
  
  return function() {
    forcePower++;
    console.log(`${name}'s force power is now ${forcePower}`);
  };
}

let trainLuke = createJedi("Luke");
trainLuke(); // Output: Luke's force power is now 1
trainLuke(); // Output: Luke's force power is now 2
```

In this example, the inner function has access to the `name` and `forcePower` variables of the outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing.

#### Practical Uses of Closures

1. **Data Privacy**:
   ```javascript
   function createLightsaber(color) {
     let energy = 100;
     
     return {
       swing: function() {
         energy -= 10;
         console.log(`Swinging ${color} lightsaber. Energy: ${energy}`);
       },
